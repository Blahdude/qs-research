From the car generated video, some of the cinematography, and the California gold rush video, I would bet a lot of money that they are gathering most of their licensing from old video games. Games like forza horizon are almost directly correlated to the car video. The car generation camera POV is basically exactly the same for car video games. The gold rush cinematography seems to be drawn exactly from the game red dead redemption's cinematography and building structures similarities. A lot of the cinematography from the japanese cities that they use seem like they could also have been drawn from japanese focused video games. While this is just a prediction, if this is true, they probably haven\u2019t spent a lot of money going after expensive licensing deals with big movie companies yet. It would be very smart to go after small, dying video game companies that have lots of video/image data. Once they go after top tier licensing hypothetically, once they optimize their models on the licensing deals they currently have, their models are going to be fantastic. Once this happens, essentially every other AI video generation company will go out of business."}),"\n"]}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.li,{children:"CONS: Struggles a lot with close up stuff in terms of realism it seems like.
